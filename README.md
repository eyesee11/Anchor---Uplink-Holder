<h1 align="center">Anchor -- Windows Upload Stabilizer</h1>

A Windows CLI tool that watches a local folder and uploads every file inside it to Google Drive using **resumable uploads**. If your connection drops mid-upload, Anchor picks up from exactly where it left off (or maybe not, just 8mb usage wasted 😛).

## The Problem Anchor Solves

Uploading large files (videos, archives, backups) over an unstable connection is painful. Standard upload clients:

- Restart from byte 0 on any failure
- Give you no visibility into what was uploaded vs. what is pending
- Block the terminal while uploading

Anchor fixes all three: it saves a **resume URI** and **byte offset** to a local SQLite database after every chunk. On restart, it reads those two values and tells Google Drive "continue from here."

---

## FAQ: Why Anchor?

**Q: Doesn’t Google Drive already support resumable uploads?**

**A:** Google Drive’s web interface and desktop sync client do not expose chunked resumable uploads to users. If you upload a large file via the browser or Drive for Desktop, a network failure often restarts the upload from zero. Anchor uses Google Drive’s API-level resumable upload protocol, saving progress after every 8MB chunk. If your connection drops, Anchor resumes from the last saved chunk, never wasting bandwidth.

**Q: What does Anchor do differently?**

- Monitors a folder on your device
- Tracks files in a local SQLite database
- Hashes files natively for speed
- Uploads files in 8MB chunks
- Recovers from network failures automatically
- Runs as a CLI tool, not a background sync client

This makes Anchor ideal for unreliable connections, large files, and power users who want granular control and visibility.

## Usage

```
anchor add-folder <path>    Watch a folder and sync all files inside to Drive
anchor status               Show upload state of every tracked file
anchor --help               Show help
anchor --version            Show version
```

Example output of `anchor status`:

```
FILE                                                    SIZE   PROGRESS     STATUS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
holiday_2025.mp4                                      2.1 GB      70%   UPLOADING
report_final.pdf                                      1.8 MB     100%       DONE
backup.zip                                            800 MB       0%    PENDING
```

### `Main.java` — Entry Point

```
anchor add-folder   →   AddFolderCommand.run()
anchor status       →   StatusCommand.run()
anchor help         →   prints usage
anchor (nothing)    →   prints usage (via @Spec + spec.commandLine().usage())
```

**Why `implements Runnable`?**  
Picocli requires the root command to be `Runnable` or `Callable`. When the user types just `anchor` with no subcommand, `run()` is invoked — we use it to print help instead of silently doing nothing.

**Why `System.exit(exitCode)`?**  
Scripts (CI pipelines, batch files) check the exit code of commands they run. `0 = success`, non-zero = failure. Without `System.exit()`, a failed subcommand would still exit 0.

---

### `cli/AddFolderCommand.java` — `anchor add-folder <path>`

Orchestrates the entire pipeline for a given folder:

1. Validates the path is a real directory
2. Opens the `ManifestStore` database connection
3. Scans existing files → hashes each with `CHasher` → inserts them as `PENDING`
4. Starts `FolderWatcher` on a daemon thread to catch future file additions
5. Blocks (`watchThread.join()`) keeping the process alive until `Ctrl+C`

**Why a daemon thread?**  
`setDaemon(true)` tells the JVM: "don't keep the process alive just for this thread." If the user presses `Ctrl+C`, the JVM can shut down even if the watcher loop is blocked waiting for events.

**`findHasherBinary()`**  
Locates `hasher.exe` (the compiled C binary) in this priority order:

1. `ANCHOR_HASHER` environment variable (most flexible — good for CI/CD)
2. Same directory as the running JAR
3. `~/.anchor/hasher.exe` (convention for user-level tools)

---

### `cli/StatusCommand.java` — `anchor status`

Queries all rows from the `ManifestStore` and prints a formatted table. Uses `printf` with `%-50s` etc. column widths for aligned output.

`formatBytes()` converts raw byte counts to human-readable strings (`1.5 GB`, `800 MB`).

---

### `hasher/HashResult.java` — C Binary Output Model

A plain data class. Its only job is to be the target of Jackson's JSON deserializer:

```json
{
  "file": "C:\\Videos\\movie.mp4",
  "sha256": "a3f1c2...",
  "size_bytes": 1572864
}
```

Jackson reads that string → produces a `HashResult` with those 3 fields populated.  
`@JsonProperty("size_bytes")` maps the snake_case JSON key to the camelCase Java field `sizeBytes`.

---

### `hasher/CHasher.java` — Subprocess Launcher

**Why a native C binary for hashing instead of Java's `MessageDigest`?**  
Java's SHA-256 is fine for small files, but for a 10 GB video it's measurably slower due to JVM overhead. The C binary using OpenSSL's optimised SHA-256 (which uses hardware AES-NI instructions) is 3–5× faster.

**How it works:**

1. `ProcessBuilder(hasherBinaryPath, filePath)` — spawns `hasher.exe C:\Videos\movie.mp4`
2. Reads all of the process's `stdout` — that's the JSON line
3. Calls `waitFor()` for the exit code (after reading stdout — reading first avoids a deadlock if the output buffer fills up)
4. Jackson deserialises the JSON into `HashResult`

---

### `manifest/FileRecord.java` — Database Row Model

Represents one tracked file. Fields split into two groups:

| Field           | `final`? | Why                                        |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `absolutePath`  | yes      | Identity — never changes                   |
| `sizeBytes`     | yes      | Fixed at the moment of hashing             |
| `sha256`        | yes      | Fixed — the file's fingerprint             |
| `status`        | no       | Changes: PENDING → UPLOADING → DONE/ERROR  |
| `bytesUploaded` | no       | Updated after every chunk                  |
| `resumeUri`     | no       | Set when session starts, cleared when done |

**Why an enum for status instead of a String?**  
A typo like `"PENIDNG"` compiles fine as a string. `Status.PENIDNG` is a compile error. Enums also enable `switch` statements.

---

### `manifest/ManifestStore.java` — Database Access Layer

The only class in the project that writes SQL. Every other class stays completely unaware that SQLite exists.

**`implements AutoCloseable`**  
Enables `try-with-resources` usage:

```java
try (ManifestStore manifest = new ManifestStore()) { ... }
```

Java automatically calls `manifest.close()` — closing the database connection — when the block exits, even on exception.

**`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`**  
Idempotent. Run on every startup: first run creates the table, subsequent runs do nothing. No need to check "does the DB exist yet."

**`PreparedStatement` everywhere, never string concatenation**  
`ps.setString(1, value)` ensures `value` is treated as data, never as SQL. String concatenation would allow SQL injection — e.g. a filename like `'); DROP TABLE files;--` would delete the database.

**`INSERT OR IGNORE`**  
If the watcher fires twice for the same file (which can happen on Windows), the second insert is silently skipped. The `UNIQUE` constraint on `absolute_path` enforces this at the database level.

**`updateProgress()` — the core of Anchor**  
Called after every 8 MB chunk is confirmed uploaded. Writes `bytesUploaded` and `resumeUri` to disk. If the process is killed after this write, the next run reads these values and resumes from the saved offset.

---

### `upload/DriveAuthHelper.java` — OAuth 2.0

Handles the one-time browser login and token persistence.

**First run:**

1. Opens `accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth` in the default browser
2. User grants permission
3. Google redirects to `localhost:9876` (our embedded Jetty server)
4. The Jetty server captures the auth code
5. Auth code is exchanged for an access token + refresh token
6. Tokens saved to `~/.anchor/tokens/`

**Subsequent runs:**  
Reads the saved refresh token from disk → silently gets a new access token. No browser interaction needed.

**`DriveScopes.DRIVE_FILE`**  
Principle of least privilege — Anchor only requests access to files it creates. It cannot read or modify any pre-existing Google Drive files.

**`credentials.json`**  
Downloaded from Google Cloud Console. Contains your OAuth client ID and secret. Must be placed at `~/.anchor/credentials.json` before first run.

---

### `upload/ResumableUploader.java` — Chunked Upload Engine

**Why resumable uploads?**  
Google Drive's standard upload requires the entire file in one HTTP request. A single packet loss at byte 8,999,999,999 of a 9 GB file restarts everything. Resumable uploads split the file into chunks; each chunk is independently retryable.

**`startOrResumeSession()`**

- If `record.resumeUri != null` (already started) → returns the saved URI directly. No new session created.
- If null (first attempt) → POSTs to `https://www.googleapis.com/upload/drive/v3/files?uploadType=resumable`. Google responds with a `Location` header containing a unique session URI. This URI is saved to `ManifestStore` _before uploading a single byte_.

**`uploadFile()` loop:**

1. `RandomAccessFile.seek(offset)` — jumps to the last confirmed byte position
2. Reads 8 MB into `buffer`
3. Builds a `PUT` request with `Content-Range: bytes START-END/TOTAL`
4. Executes the request
5. On success: increments `offset`, saves new offset to DB
6. Repeat until `offset == totalSize`

**`CHUNK_SIZE = 8 MB`**  
Google requires chunk sizes to be exact multiples of **256 KB** (except the last chunk). 8 MB (= 32 × 256 KB) is efficient without being so large that a failure wastes significant progress.

---

### `watcher/FolderWatcher.java` — OS File-Event Listener

**Why not polling?**  
A `while(true) { Thread.sleep(1000); scanFolder(); }` loop burns CPU and misses rapid changes. Instead, `WatchService` hooks into:

- Windows: `ReadDirectoryChangesW`
- Linux: `inotify`
- macOS: `kqueue`

The OS pushes events to the application — zero CPU between changes.

**`volatile boolean running`**  
Standard graceful-shutdown pattern for threads. When another thread sets `watcher.stop()`, the watcher's loop reads the updated `running = false` on its next iteration. `volatile` ensures CPU-cache coherency — without it, the write in one thread might never be seen by another.

**`key.reset()`**  
Mandatory after calling `key.pollEvents()`. Failing to call this is the #1 `WatchService` bug — the key enters a consumed state and all future file events are silently dropped.

**`ws.poll(1, SECONDS)` vs `ws.take()`**  
`take()` blocks forever — can't be interrupted by `running = false`. `poll(1, SECONDS)` gives the loop a chance to check `running` every second, enabling clean shutdown on `Ctrl+C`.

**`Consumer<Path> onNewFile`**  
A functional interface (lambda) passed in by the caller. The watcher doesn't import or depend on the uploader — it just calls `onNewFile.accept(path)`. This decouples the two components.
